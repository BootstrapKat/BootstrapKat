# 👋 Hey, I'm Kat!  
> Front-End Developer | Occasional Tinkerer | UI/UX Enthusiast  

I'm a front-end developer with a strong focus on **accessible, scalable, and maintainable** code. I specialize in building component-driven UIs that don’t just *look* good, but *work* well for everyone.  

Currently wrangling **Gatsby + Drupal** into something coherent. Previously built large-scale features for **Google Next**, **Purina**, worked on **Drupal CMS projects**, and helped keep things **A11Y-compliant** across multiple platforms.  

## 🔧 What I Work With  
🖥️ **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, PHP (as needed, begrudgingly)  
🌐 **Front-End:** React, Gatsby, Vue, Twig, Angular  
🎨 **UI/UX:** Figma, Storybook  
🔩 **Other Stuff:** Drupal, DDEV, Docker, Cloud (Google, but let’s not talk about that)  

## 💡 What I’m Into  
- **UI/UX Design:** Making things that are actually usable.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Because *fast* is a feature.  
- **Progressive Web Apps:** Web apps should feel like real apps.  
- **Creative Coding:** Occasionally dabbling in CSS art and generative design.  

## ✨ Fun Facts  
- I once had to learn **Vue in a month** to build a major event site. It worked out (somehow).  
- I started out in **accessibility engineering** and will absolutely side-eye your div soup.  
- **Minimalism in code, maximalism in hobbies**—I sew, crochet, cross-stitch, and garden (with varying success).  
- **Always open to nerding out** about UX, design systems, and front-end architecture.
